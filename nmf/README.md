# Rerunning NMF

**Note that NMF is NOT rerun by default.**  Instead, this repository comes with the NMF outputs that were originally generated (stored in `nmf/adni/results/mat` and `nmf/oasis3/results/mat`).  This ensures that all analyses are run using the same components as I had.

To rerun the NMF for a dataset, the MATLAB script `nmf/adni/run_nmf.m` can be used (and the equivalent for OASIS3).  This will **regenerate and overwrite** the outputs in `nmf/adni/results/mat`.  On my laptop, this takes only a couple minutes.

The [intra-sample reproducibility analysis](https://github.com/sotiraslab/nmf_tau/blob/main/supplement/figS1/intrasample_reproducibility.py) is also not rerun by default.  The data required for creating this plot are stored in `nmf/adni/results/repeat_reproducibility_mat/reproducibilityResults.mat` (and the equivalent for OASIS3).  This file can be regenerated by using `run_repeated_reproducibility.m` and subsequently `evaluate_repeated_reproducibility.m`.  **On my laptop, the first script takes a few hours to run.**
